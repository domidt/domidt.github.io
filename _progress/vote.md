Today, most developed capital markets have regulations restricting insider trading in place. In the adoption process of insider trading legislation, many stakeholders contribute their interests and often it is not clear whether these interests are in line with the interests of the people actually acting on financial markets. This assertion is supported by accumulating evidence raising doubts as to the effectiveness of insider trading regulation, questioning the dominance of the currently prevailing practice.

In this paper, we, therefore, study traders' choice for regulation in an experimental market setting conditional on traders' prospects of becoming an informed trader. We find that in markets where uninformed traders have no chance of receiving inside information, elections turned out 15 times (47%) against and 17 times (53%) in favor of regulation. This result contrasts with the results of markets where all traders have a chance of receiving inside information. In these markets, 26 (81%) elections turned out against and six (19%) elections in favor of regulation.
