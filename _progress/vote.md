Most developed capital markets enforce regulations restricting insider trading. In the process of adopting insider trading regulation, many stakeholders communicate their interests and often it is not clear whether these interests are in line with the preferences of traders in financial markets. This paper studies traders' regulation choices in an experimental market setting conditional on traders' prospects of becoming an informed trader. 

Evaluating the outcomes of 64 referenda, we find that 41 (64\%) are decided against regulation. More specifically, in markets in which uninformed traders have no chance of receiving inside information, 47\% of referenda turned out against regulation. In contrast, in markets in which all traders have a chance of receiving inside information, 81\% of referenda turned out against regulation. Moreover, traders' voting behavior is stable across referenda that determine the regulation for future trading phases, yet we observe a significant shift in votes toward regulation in a hypothetical choice, which does not determine future regulation.
