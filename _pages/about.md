I am student in the [PhD Programme in Economics](https://www.uibk.ac.at/studium/angebot/phd-phd-program-economics.html.en) at the University of Innsbruck. Via a project funded by the OeNB Anniversary Fund together with [Thomas St√∂ckl](https://www.mci.edu/de/faculty/thomas.stoeckl) and [Stefan Palan](https://academic.palan.biz/home), I currently conduct experimental research to shed light on the effects and preferences over insider trading regulation.
My academic background include microeconomic fields, in particular game theory, together with behavioural economics and experimental economics. Since Innsbruck offers many opportunities to get taught statistical approaches, I have further included advanced statistical and econometric subjects to my curriculum.

My passion for research is driven by the ambitious objective to archieve further insights in economies which suffer from informational imperfections.
I try to fulfill a supportive role in this process towards more efficient markets.
Specifically, I conduct fundamental research to analyse adviser markets, information procurement, the distribution of alternative information, and insider trading.
