I am student in the [https://www.uibk.ac.at/studium/angebot/phd-phd-program-economics.html.en](PhD Programme in Economics) at the University of Innsbruck. Via the project funded by the OeNB Anniversary Fund together with [https://www.mci.edu/de/faculty/thomas.stoeckl](Thomas St√∂ckl) and [https://academic.palan.biz/home](Stefan Palan), I currently conduct experimental research about insider trading regulation.
