I am student in the [PhD Programme in Economics](https://www.uibk.ac.at/studium/angebot/phd-phd-program-economics.html.en) at the University of Innsbruck. Via the project funded by the OeNB Anniversary Fund together with [Thomas St√∂ckl](https://www.mci.edu/de/faculty/thomas.stoeckl) and [Stefan Palan](https://academic.palan.biz/home), I currently conduct experimental research about insider trading regulation.
My academic background includes mainly microeconomic fields, in particular Game Theory, together with behavioural economics and experimental economics. Due to Innsbruck's opportunities to teach statistical approaches and my interest in this area, I have further included statistical and econometric subjects to my curriculum.
