I am student in the [PhD Programme in Economics](https://www.uibk.ac.at/studium/angebot/phd-phd-program-economics.html.en) at the University of Innsbruck. Via a project funded by the OeNB Anniversary Fund together with [Thomas St√∂ckl](https://www.mci.edu/de/faculty/thomas.stoeckl) and [Stefan Palan](https://academic.palan.biz/home), I currently conduct experimental research to shed light on the effects and preference over insider trading regulation.
My academic background includes mainly microeconomic fields, in particular Game Theory, together with behavioural economics and experimental economics. Since Innsbruck offers  many opportunities to get taught statistical approaches, I have further included advanced statistical and econometric subjects to my curriculum.
