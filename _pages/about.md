I am postdoc researcher at the Universität Augsburg. In a joint project with [Thomas Stöckl](https://www.mci.edu/de/faculty/thomas.stoeckl) and [Stefan Palan](https://academic.palan.biz/home), funded by the OeNB Anniversary Fund, I conducted experimental research to shed light on the effects and on preferences over insider trading regulation, I conducted experimental research on prediction markets at the Université Paris 1 - Panthéon Sorbonne ([Centre d'Économie de la Sorbonne](https://centredeconomiesorbonne.cnrs.fr/)).
My academic background includes microeconomic fields, in particular game theory, together with behavioural economics and experimental economics.

My passion for research is driven by the ambitious objective to achieve further insights in economies which suffer from informational imperfections.
I try to fulfill a supportive role in this process towards more efficient markets.
Specifically, I conduct fundamental research to analyse adviser markets, information procurement, the distribution of information, and insider trading.
