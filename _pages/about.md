I am student in the [PhD Programme in Economics](https://www.uibk.ac.at/studium/angebot/phd-phd-program-economics.html.en) at the University of Innsbruck. In a joint project with [Thomas St√∂ckl](https://www.mci.edu/de/faculty/thomas.stoeckl) and [Stefan Palan](https://academic.palan.biz/home), funded by the OeNB Anniversary Fund, I currently conduct experimental research to shed light on the effects and on preferences over insider trading regulation.
My academic background includes microeconomic fields, in particular game theory, together with behavioural economics and experimental economics. Since Innsbruck offers many opportunities to get taught statistical approaches, I have further included advanced statistical and econometric subjects to my curriculum.

My passion for research is driven by the ambitious objective to archieve further insights in economies which suffer from informational imperfections.
I try to fulfill a supportive role in this process towards more efficient markets.
Specifically, I conduct fundamental research to analyse adviser markets, information procurement, the distribution of information, and insider trading.
