In this course, students are expected to develop their critical ability to independently undertake and solve business problems using scientific methods. We start by reviewing different research methods and outlining the quantitative research process. Following a hands-on approach, we will, step-by-step, guide them through carrying out a small empirical research project in which they directly apply their new knowledge. Specifically, they learn how to develop, design, and implement a questionnaire for a predefined topic. Based on the collected data, they learn how to properly analyze it and how to prsent the research process as well as its results in form of a scientific paper. Note that in this process you 

will also have to utilize your knowledge and skills gained in previous courses teaching you scientific-

methodical competencies (e.g., “Academic Research & Writing”, several courses on mathematical and 

statistical methods, and the use of statistical software packages)

Having completed the course, you will have acquired sound theoretical knowledge and developed prac-

tical skills so that you are able to 

• draft a concept for and develop an empirical survey based on a questionnaire.

• determine and operationalize variables.

• choose the appropriate scales and types of questions.

• structure a questionnaire.

• discuss quality-related aspects like scientific quality criteria and pretests
