In this course, students develop practical skills in finding, defining, and implementing an appropriate research project. 
To achieve these goals, they draft a research proposal describing a research project and its implementation with suitable instruments. During the project, students apply their knowledge and skills gained in previous courses in the fields of academic writing, scientific methods, and literature research. Working on the project prepares students for defining and implementing their
own and independent research for the bachelor thesis.
